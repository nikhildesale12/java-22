The Foreign Linker API, which allows Java to link to native code without JNI, is still in the incubator stage in JDK 22.

What it does:

This API allows Java to dynamically call native functions and load native libraries more easily, removing the complexity of using traditional JNI.

Benefits:

Simplifies integration with native libraries by automating the process of function linking and memory management.
Better performance for applications that require frequent interaction with native code.

Example:


// Linking to a native library function using the Foreign Linker API
Library lib = Linker.load("mylibrary");
Function func = lib.lookup("nativeFunction");
func.invoke();
