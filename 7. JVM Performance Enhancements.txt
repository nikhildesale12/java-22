Every new JDK version brings significant performance improvements for JVM and garbage collection, and Java 22 is expected to continue this trend.

What it does:

Java 22 includes further optimizations for garbage collection, especially for collectors like ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) and Shenandoah GC, which aim to provide low-latency garbage collection and improve the performance of applications with large heaps.
JVM optimizations might include improvements in startup times, memory footprint, and concurrency.

Benefits:

Faster application startup and lower memory usage, making Java more suitable for resource-constrained environments (e.g., microservices).
Improved throughput for applications with large data sets.
