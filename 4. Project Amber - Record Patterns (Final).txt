Record Patterns were first introduced in JDK 16 and received further refinement in JDK 20. By JDK 22, Record Patterns are expected to be finalized.

What it does:

Record patterns allow for more concise extraction of data from records by using patterns to deconstruct records. This is useful for accessing and manipulating data in immutable types.

Benefits:

Cleaner code: Record patterns allow you to destructure records in one step, reducing boilerplate code.
More readable code when dealing with immutable data types.

Example:


record Person(String name, int age) {}

Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);

// Using Record Pattern
if (person instanceof Person(String name, int age)) {
    System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old");
}
