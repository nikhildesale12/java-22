Java 22 (JDK 22) is set to be released in September 2024 as part of Java's ongoing six-month release cycle. While detailed information about Java 22's final features will be available once it is officially released, I can provide a preview of the expected features, 
based on the evolution of Java in recent years and ongoing projects. Many of the features previewed in earlier versions, especially those from JEPs (JDK Enhancement Proposals), may continue to mature or be finalized in Java 22.

Below are the key features likely to be included in Java 22, with detailed explanations based on expected enhancements and the preview/incubator features introduced in earlier versions.
