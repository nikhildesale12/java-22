Java 22 may include improvements to the JVM's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, which provides enhancements in execution speed and reduced startup times.

What it does:

The JIT compiler is likely to continue improving to make Java applications run faster.
Expect continued improvements to loop unrolling, inlining optimizations, and auto-vectorization.

Benefits:

Improved performance for both short-running and long-running applications.
More efficient code execution, leading to faster response times and reduced CPU utilization.
